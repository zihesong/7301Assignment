# Assignment 1 - Part 2 & 3

### Part 2:    
Since all the java files have been compiled properly, just run `$ java Java8ParserTest_Part_2 Test.java`.  
The result will show all the boolean variables and corresponding line number in `if statement` with `length > 3` and used without `!`.  
Result:
```
$ java Java8ParserTest_Part_2 Test.java
  threaded 146  
  threaded 167  
  diag 271  
  bail 272  
  notree 277  
  printTree 279  
```
